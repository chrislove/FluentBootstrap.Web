        <p>In order to provide the most flexibility, FluentBootstrap does not code with a dependency on Bootstrap. This allows you to select the most appropriate mechanism of including Bootstrap for your situation. For example, you can use the default <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/bootstrap/">Bootstrap NuGet package</a>, or use the LESS source. You can even go to the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap web site</a> and download the CSS for manual inclusion. However you get Bootstrap, the corresponding CSS and JavaScript must be included on your page(s).</p>
        <p>Note that you will want to match the version of Bootstrap to the version of FluentBootstrap (or vice versa). Since FluentBootstrap may be a version behind the official Bootstrap release, you may need to get a previous version of Bootstrap. To do this on NuGet with the standard Bootstrap package, you would type the following into the Package Management Console: <code>Install-Package Bootstrap -Version X.X.X</code>.</p>
    
        @**********************************@

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).PageHeader("Get FluentBootstrap").SetId("get-fluentbootstrap")
        <p>FluentBootstrap is designed to work in any environment. It consists of a code library, and in most cases, an architecture-specific library. The following instructions detail how to set up FluentBootstrap for various platforms.</p>

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Alert(AlertState.Warning, "Note that it's important to get the correct NuGet package. FluentBootstrap supports a variety of different platforms and downloading the wrong package may not work in your environment. For example, download FluentBootstrap.Mvc if using ASP.NET MVC. See below for more details.")

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("ASP.NET MVC")
        <p>The easiest way to get FluentBootstrap working on ASP.NET MVC is to get the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentBootstrap.Mvc/">FluentBootstrap.Mvc NuGet package</a>. This will pull down both the core library and the special support for ASP.NET MVC including the Bootstrap model binding helpers.</p>
        <p>All of the extensions for FluentBootstrap are under the root <code>FluentBootstrap</code> namespace. In order to access this namespace from your view code, you'll probably want to add it to your <code>web.config</code> like this:</p>
        @Html.Code(@"<system.web.webPages.razor>
            <host .../>
            <pages ...>
                <namespaces>
                    ...
                    <add namespace=""FluentBootstrap"" />
                </namespaces>
            </pages>
        </system.web.webPages.razor>")

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading3("T4MVC")
        <p>FluentBootstrap also has a supporting library for T4MVC, <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentBootstrap.Mvc.T4MVC/">FluentBootstrap.Mvc.T4MVC</a>. This allows you to use a T4MVC <code>ActionResult</code> anywhere a link is accepted.</p>

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("ASP.NET WebPages")
        <p>If you prefer to use ASP.NET WebPages, you can get the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentBootstrap.WebPages/">FluentBootstrap.WebPages NuGet package</a>. This will pull down both the core library and the special support for ASP.NET WebPages. You will need to include <code>@@using FluentBootstrap</code> at the top of every page. You will also need to pass in the page instance when using the helper like <code>@@Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading1("My Header")</code>. This is because the ASP.NET WebPages <code>HtmlHelper</code> class does not provide all the information needed to use FluentBootstrap (such as access to the request context).</p>

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("Use It Directly")
        <p>If you are outside of ASP.NET or you just want to generate Bootstrap HTML strings, then you can get by with just the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentBootstrap/">FluentBootstrap NuGet package</a>. This provides a <code>SimpleBootstrapHelper</code> class that you could instantiate to get access to all of the FluentBootstrap extensions.</p>

        @**********************************@

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).PageHeader("Usage").SetId("usage")

        <p>Most of the functionality in FluentBootstrap is provided via extension methods on a special <code>BootstrapHelper</code> class obtained through the standard <code>HtmlHelper</code>. This helps segregate the many extension methods and keeps them from polluting the standard <code>HtmlHelper</code> extensions list. In general, you get access to the <code>BootstrapHelper</code> class as <code>@@Html.Bootstrap()</code>.</p>
        <p>FluentBootstrap is designed as a fluent interface, which means that most components are configured via a chain of method calls. In general, you create a component after getting the <code>BootstrapHelper</code> and then configure it until it's output. A typical FluentBootstrap component might look like this:</p>
        @Html.Code(@"@Html.Bootstrap().Dropdown(""My Dropdown"").SetSize(ButtonSize.Xs).SetState(ButtonState.Warning)")
        <p>Components are also often provided with overloaded initial methods so that you don't need to use the fluent interface for the most common scenarios. For example:</p>
        @Html.Code(@"@Html.Bootstrap().Alert(AlertState.Warning, ""Warning"", ""Yikes, this is a warning."")")
        <p>Alternatively, in ASP.NET MVC you can write code like <code>@@Bootstrap.Heading1("My Header")</code> (notice that there's no <code>Html.</code> call) by creating a property in your base page class (if you don't have a custom base page class, <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2011/02/21/changing-base-type-of-a-razor-view.aspx">see here for instructions on how to create one</a>):</p>
        @Html.Code(@"public MvcBootstrapHelper<TModel> Bootstrap
            {
                get { return Html.Bootstrap(); }
            }")
        <p>You can also reduce the verbosity by creating and holding a reference to the <code>BootstrapHelper</code> object. Since it doesn't maintain any state, it can be repeatedly reused for FluentBootstrap components:</p>
        @Html.Code(@"var b = Html.Bootstrap();
            ...
            @b.Alert(AlertState.Warning, ""My Alert"")
            ...
            @b.Heading2(""Some Heading"")
            ...")

        @**********************************@

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).PageHeader("Output").SetId("output")

        <p>FluentBootstrap has a number of different ways to get the rendered HTML of your component (for example, to write it to the page output stream).</p>

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("IHtmlString and ToHtmlString()")

        <p>When you use the @@ symbol in Razor, you're really passing an object to the Razor rendering engine and telling it to write that object to the output stream. One of the main ways it does this is to look for the object to implement <code>IHtmlString</code>. All of the FluentBootstrap component implement this interface and will render their HTML to the output stream when used with the @@ symbol. Keep in mind that this rendering will occur <em>at the end</em> of the fluent method chain once all methods have been evaluated.</p>


        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("IDisposable And Begin/End")

        <p>FluentBootstrap components can also be used as <code>IDisposable</code> objects (primarily for use in <code>using</code> statements for automatic tag closing). To do this, you need to call <code>.Begin()</code> on the component (for a discussion about why you have to make an extra call to get the IDisposable, <a href="http://www.daveaglick.com/posts/method-chaining-fluent-interfaces-and-the-finishing-problem">see here</a>). As soon as you call <code>.Begin()</code>, the component is immediately rendered to the output stream and a special wrapper is returned that provides extensions specific to the component being rendered.</p>
        @Html.Code(@"using (var list = Html.Bootstrap().List(ListType.Ordered).Begin())
            {
                @list.ListItem(""One"")
                @list.ListItem(""Two"")
            }")
        <p>If you forget to call <code>.Begin()</code>, you will get a compile-time error if you have pre-compilation turned on, or a run-time error if not, informing you that the component could not be converted to an <code>IDisposable</code>. This is intentional and is intended to ensure you remember to call <code>.Begin()</code> when using a component in a <code>using</code> statement.</p>
        <p>As an alternative to a <code>using</code> statement, you can also manually begin and end the component.</p>
        @Html.Code(@"var list = Html.Bootstrap().List(ListType.Ordered).Begin();
            @list.ListItem(""One"")
            @list.ListItem(""Two"")
            list.End();")
        <p>Notice how <code>list.End();</code> is not preceded by a @@. That's because both <code>.Begin()</code> and <code>.End()</code> write directly to the output stream and do not return an <code>IHtmlString</code> interface. If you forget and add the @@, you will get a compile-time error if you have pre-compilation turned on, or a run-time error if not.</p>

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("Alternative Begin Syntax")

        <p>Alternatively, you can also use a special lambda syntax to begin your components if you don't like the explicit <code>.Begin()</code> call. To do this, call <code>.Begin()</code> immediately after the call to <code>.Bootstrap()</code> and construct your component as a function:</p>

        @Html.Code(@"using(var list = Html.Bootstrap().Begin(x => x.List(ListType.Ordered)))
            {
                ...
            }")

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("Outputting to a String")

        <p>It's also possible to defer rendering and/or output the component to a string.</p>
        @Html.Code(@"var dropdown = Html.Bootstrap().Dropdown(""My Dropdown"");
            dropdown.SetSize(ButtonSize.Xs);
            dropdown.SetState(ButtonState.Warning);
            var renderedDropdown = dropdown.ToString();")
        <p>This approach can be helpful if you're trying to output content for JavaScript or otherwise need to post-process the rendered component.</p>

        @**********************************@

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).PageHeader("Children").SetId("children")

        <p>Many Bootstrap components have logical children. For example, a grid row has grid columns and a list has list items. FluentBootstrap has a number of facilities to help with children. For starters, when you use <code>.Begin()</code> to use a component inside a <code>using</code> statement, an object will be returned that restricts the list of additional FluentBootstrap components to those children that are most common for the containing component (keep in mind that you're not limited to what the returned class provides - you can always use the default <code>BootstrapHelper</code> inside another component).</p>
        <p>Another scenario you might encounter is when you need to build an entire component hierarchy without outputting to the output stream. This can be accomplished using the <code>.AddChild()</code> extension method. For example:</p>
        @Html.Code(@"string list = Html.Bootstrap().List(ListType.Ordered)
            .AddChild(x => x.ListItem(""One""))
            .AddChild(x => x.ListItem(""Two""))
            .ToString();")
        <p>Each call to <code>.AddChild()</code> returns context back to the original component when done. If on the other hand you just want to add a single child and maintain the fluent chain you can use the <code>.WithChild()</code> extension method.</p>
        @Html.Code(@"@Html.Bootstrap().List(ListType.Ordered).WithChild().ListItem(""Single List Item"")")

        @**********************************@

        @Html.Bootstrap(this).PageHeader("Mixing Code And Markup").SetId("mixing")

        <p>There is nothing wrong with mixing FluentBootstrap code and regular HTML markup or Bootstrap CSS. The two are designed to work well together, and it is recommended that you use whatever syntax provides the most understanding and benefit in your view code. For example, while FluentBootstrap has a <code>.Paragraph()</code> extension, you'll probably want to use the standard <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> HTML tag instead because it's much shorter.</p>
        <p>The one thing to keep in mind when mixing code and markup is that you may need to change context from code back to markup if you're inside a FluentBootstrap code block and you don't need to open a new HTML tag. Thankfully, Razor provides both the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> tag and the <code>@@:</code> syntax to help achieve this. @Html.Bootstrap(this).Link("Here is a great blog article", "http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/asp-net-mvc-3-razor-s-and-lt-text-gt-syntax") on the use of these two syntactical features.</p>

        @Html.Code(@"@using(var row = Html.Bootstrap().GridRow().Begin())
            {
                using(row.GridColumn(12).Begin())
                {
                    // We are in a code context here and need to escape back to markup
                    <text>My content.</text>
                }
            }")
    
        @Html.Bootstrap(this).Heading2("CSS Classes")
    
        <p>In fact, if you need to write HTML markup but still want the benefit of statically-typed Bootstrap CSS class names, you can use the static <code>Css</code> class. It contains <code>const</code> strings for every CSS class defined in the Bootstrap stylesheet. This allows you to swap out class name magic strings for string constants.</p>
    
        @Html.Code(@"<p class=""@Css.TextInfo"">This is some informational text.</p>")
