# FluentBootstrap.Web
## Overview
This is the code for the public web site of FluentBootstrap - http://fluentbootstrap.com

FluentBoostrap is a library designed to make working with the Bootstrap CSS framework easier in a code-based environment. It enables using Bootstrap (and to some extent, regular HTML elements) in a variety of different ways without having to worry about HTML, CSS, etc. The goal is to have strongly-typed classes, methods, and extensions that cover as much of the Bootstrap library as possible. Support for ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebPages is currently provided.
